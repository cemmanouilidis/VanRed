VanRed (eVaporate and Reauthor DVDs) is an application which makes it possible to copy the main movie from a DVD to your hard disc and which allows you to remove certain audio and subtitle streams and evaporates (requant) if necessary the video stream.

The application combines the power of lsdvd [1] and streamanalyze [2] to analyze the content of a DVD and (tries) to calculate the title of the DVD that contain the main movie.

The information, that are readed and calculated are about (depends on the reading mode):
   certain audio streams (language, format, channels, frequency, size, etc.)
   certain subtitle streams (language and size)
   the video stream (resolution, code, size etc.)
   the title (number of audio and subtitle streams, number of chapters, number of cells contained in a PGC (programm chain), color palette, size, etc.)

VanReD works in interactive mode and firstly determines the content of a DVD. In a second step the user is asked which of the audio and subtitle streams he wants to keep. With the collected information VanReD generates a XML file for dvdauthor, that specifies the new DVD structure and a color palette containing color information for subtitles. Last the generated XML file is passed to dvdauthor.

In order to run VanRed you will need in addition the following piece of software:
   libdvdread from the ogle project: http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/   
   dvdauthor: http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/
   vamps and play_cell since version 0.98: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vamps

Todo:
   - Gtk2 GUI with preview (xine-lib). CANCELED. not enough Gtk documentation out there, i will do probably an QT 4 app
   - Ability to add a simple menu to the DVD
