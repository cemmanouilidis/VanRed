VanRed (eVaporate and Reauthor DVDs) 
Copy the main movie of a DVD to your hard disc and select which audio and subtitles to keep.

The following information are provided about a DVD:
   - Audio Streams (language, format, channels, frequency, size, etc.)
   - Subtitle Streams (language and size)
   - Video Stream (resolution, code, size etc.)
   - Title (number of audio and subtitle streams, number of chapters, number of cells contained in a PGC (programm chain), color palette, size, etc.)

In order to build and run VanRed you will need in addition the following piece of software:
   libdvdread 
   dvdauthor
   vamps and play_cell 

   Ubuntu users: sudo apt-get install libdvdread-dev dvdauthor vamps 


Known Issues:
VanRed was imported to git to continue developing (maybe) after several years. 
The current version v0.6.1 does not work with current dvdauthor versions. 
Nevertheless the option -I provides useful disc information
